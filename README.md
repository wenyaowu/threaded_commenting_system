# Threaded Commenting System
  This is the threaded commenting system that I developed for my [Amigo with Django challenge #1- Reddit-Django.](https://github.com/wenyaowu/reddit-django)
  The goal of this project is to build a comment system similar to reddit, for example: [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/349umh/annnnnnnd_we_should_turn_around/)
  The system allow you to:
    - Comment on the post
    - Comment on the comment, build a comment tree
    - Expand/ close the comment content

# Algorithm
  The algorithm used to implement the system is called Materialized Path.
  
# Requirement
  To run this demo or use this system, you need:
  - Django 1.4+
  - [Postgresql](http://postgresapp.com/) 8.x or later: You can find installation tutorial [here](http://djangogirls.gitbooks.io/django-girls-tutorial-extensions/content/optional_postgresql_installation/README.html)
  - [DBarray](https://github.com/ecometrica/django-dbarray)
